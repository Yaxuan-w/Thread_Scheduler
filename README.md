# Thread_Scheduler
-	Use priority queue to design an algorithm that works for all schedule algorithms.
-	Utilize callbacks to take advantage of the commonality of the four algorithms.
-	Realize the self-scheduling of the task thread by checking the parameters of the given algorithm without scheduler thread running.
-	Design and complete the overall coding logic, complete the compilation of specific data structures, and combine member codes.
